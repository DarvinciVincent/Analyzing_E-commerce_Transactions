## Project Description : 
In the fast-changing world of online shopping, our data whiz, Alex, embarked on an exciting journey. With Python and SQL as trusted companions, he explored a vast e-commerce dataset in three key phases: Data Cleanup, Cohort Analysis, and SQL Insights.<br>

In the first phase, Data Cleanup with Python, Alex carefully combed through the dataset, fixing missing information and sorting out errors. He made sure the data was ready for the next steps.<br>

The second phase, Cohort Analysis with Python, was where things got interesting. Alex grouped customers based on their shopping habits and timelines. This revealed secrets about customer loyalty and how people shop online, like deciphering a hidden code.<br>

The final phase led Alex into the world of SQL Insights and Queries. Using SQL, he found answers to important questions. SQL helped Alex find these answers, giving us a full picture of e-commerce.<br>

With each line of code and every SQL query, Alex didn't just find answers; he paved the way for smarter decisions. This project wasn't just about numbers; it was about helping e-commerce thrive in a competitive world.<br>

Join us on this data-driven journey as we follow Alex's steps, revealing the secrets of online shopping success.<br>

## Objective : 
The objective of this project is to leverage Python and SQL for comprehensive data analysis and insights in the context of e-commerce. The project is divided into three key phases: Data Cleanup, Cohort Analysis, and SQL Insights. In the Data Cleanup phase, we aim to ensure the dataset's quality and readiness for analysis. In the Cohort Analysis phase, we intend to uncover customer behavior patterns and loyalty insights. Finally, in the SQL Insights phase, we seek to extract valuable information and answers to critical questions, ultimately contributing to data-informed decision-making in the competitive world of online shopping. Through this project, we aim to empower e-commerce businesses with actionable insights and strategies for success.<br>

## Data Sources and Dataset column descriptions : 
**The project leverages one key table that provides valuable information for analysis:**
1. transaction_id: This is a unique identifier for each transaction, allowing you to track and reference specific purchases.

2. product_id: This column represents the unique identifier for each product in your inventory. It allows you to associate transactions with the specific products customers have purchased.

3. customer_id: This column contains unique identifiers for each customer who has made a transaction. It helps in tracking and analyzing customer behavior and preferences.

4. transaction_date: This column records the date and time when each transaction occurred. It provides a timestamp for when customers made their purchases.

5. online_order: This binary column indicates whether the transaction was made True and False. It helps in understanding the channel through which customers place orders.

6. order_status: This column denotes the status of each transaction, such as "Approved" or "Cancelled." It allows you to track the progress and outcome of each order.

7. brand: This column specifies the brand of the product that was purchased. It helps in categorizing and analyzing sales by brand.

8. product_line: This column categorizes products into different lines or categories, such as "Standard", "Premium", "Low" and so on It allows you to analyze sales and customer preferences by product category.

9. list_price: This column represents the price at which the product was listed or sold to customers. It is an important metric for revenue calculation and pricing strategies.

10. standard_cost: This column indicates the cost of producing or procuring the product. It is crucial for calculating profit margins and understanding the cost structure.

11. product_first_sold_date: This column records the date when each product was first sold. It provides information about product lifecycle and helps in analyzing the popularity of newer products.
